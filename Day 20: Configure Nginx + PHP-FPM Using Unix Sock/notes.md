🌐 Simple Explanation: Nginx + PHP-FPM

🏗️ How Web Servers Work:
text
User → Web Server → PHP Processor → Response
🔄 Two Ways to Connect:
Old Way (Slow):
Nginx talks to PHP using files (like passing notes)

Like: Postal mail - slow and inefficient

New Way (Fast - Unix Socket):
Nginx talks to PHP using a direct pipe

Like: Phone call - instant communication

/var/run/php-fpm/default.sock = the phone line

🧩 What Each Does:
Nginx: Serves web pages (the receptionist)

PHP-FPM: Processes PHP code (the worker)

Unix Socket: Direct connection between them (internal phone)

⚡ Why Unix Socket?
Faster than network connections

More secure (local only)

Better performance for PHP apps

🔧 Simple Setup:
Install Nginx + PHP-FPM

Create socket file path

Tell PHP-FPM: "Use this socket"

Tell Nginx: "Send PHP files to this socket"

Start both services

That's it! The socket is just a fast communication channel between the web server and PHP processor. 🚀


Exactly! Here's where we did those steps:

1. Create socket file path
sudo mkdir -p /var/run/php-fpm/  # Created the directory for the socket
2. Tell PHP-FPM: "Use this socket"
# In file: /etc/opt/remi/php83/php-fpm.d/www.conf
listen = /var/run/php-fpm/default.sock  # ← This line tells PHP-FPM where to create the socket
3. Tell Nginx: "Send PHP files to this socket"
# In file: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf  
fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php-fpm/default.sock;  # ← This line tells Nginx where to send PHP files
So the flow is:

We create the directory (/var/run/php-fpm/)

PHP-FPM creates the socket file there when it starts

Nginx knows to send PHP requests to that socket

PHP-FPM receives requests, processes PHP, sends back through socket

The socket file gets automatically created when PHP-FPM starts! You just need to tell both services the same address. 🎯
