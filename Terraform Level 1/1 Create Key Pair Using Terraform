The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units. This granular approach enables the team to execute the migration in gradual phases, ensuring smoother implementation and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations. By breaking down the migration into smaller tasks, the Nautilus DevOps team can systematically progress through each stage, allowing for better control, risk mitigation, and optimization of resources throughout the migration process.

For this task, create a key pair using Terraform with the following requirements:

Name of the key pair should be nautilus-kp.

Key pair type must be rsa.

The private key file should be saved under /home/bob/nautilus-kp.pem.
The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to accomplish this task.

Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

Lab 1: Create Key Pair Using Terraform
Simple Explanation
This lab teaches you to create an SSH key pair using Terraform. You'll generate a secure RSA key pair where the public key gets stored in AWS and the private key is saved locally for secure authentication to AWS resources.

Key Terms
Key Pair: Cryptographic keys (public + private) for secure server authentication

RSA: Encryption algorithm used for secure data transmission

Terraform Resource: Infrastructure component defined in Terraform code

SSH: Protocol for secure remote server access

Benefits and Use Cases
Secure Server Access: More secure than password-based authentication

AWS EC2 Instances: Required for SSH access to cloud servers

Automation: Enables scripted access without manual intervention

Infrastructure as Code: Consistent, version-controlled key management
