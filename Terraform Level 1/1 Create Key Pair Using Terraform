The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units. This granular approach enables the team to execute the migration in gradual phases, ensuring smoother implementation and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations. By breaking down the migration into smaller tasks, the Nautilus DevOps team can systematically progress through each stage, allowing for better control, risk mitigation, and optimization of resources throughout the migration process.

For this task, create a key pair using Terraform with the following requirements:

Name of the key pair should be xfusion-kp.

Key pair type must be rsa.

The private key file should be saved under /home/bob/xfusion-kp.pem.
The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to accomplish this task.

Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

Lab 1: Create Key Pair Using Terraform
Simple Explanation
This lab teaches you to create an SSH key pair using Terraform. You'll generate a secure RSA key pair where the public key gets stored in AWS and the private key is saved locally for secure authentication to AWS resources.

Key Terms
Key Pair: Cryptographic keys (public + private) for secure server authentication

RSA: Encryption algorithm used for secure data transmission

Terraform Resource: Infrastructure component defined in Terraform code

SSH: Protocol for secure remote server access

Benefits and Use Cases
Secure Server Access: More secure than password-based authentication

AWS EC2 Instances: Required for SSH access to cloud servers

Automation: Enables scripted access without manual intervention

Infrastructure as Code: Consistent, version-controlled key management

Step-by-Step Solution
Step 1: Open Terminal in VS Code

Right-click in the EXPLORER section (left panel)

Select "Open in Integrated Terminal"

This will open a terminal at the bottom of VS Code

Step 2: Navigate to Terraform Directory

bash
cd /home/bob/terraform
Step 3: Create main.tf File

bash
touch main.tf
Step 4: Edit main.tf File

Click on the main.tf file in VS Code explorer to open it

Copy and paste the following Terraform code:

main.tf File Content
hcl
# Generate RSA private key
resource "tls_private_key" "nautilus_rsa" {
  algorithm = "RSA"
  rsa_bits  = 4096
}

# Create AWS key pair
resource "aws_key_pair" "nautilus_key" {
  key_name   = "nautilus-kp"
  public_key = tls_private_key.nautilus_rsa.public_key_openssh
}

# Save private key to file
resource "local_file" "private_key" {
  content     = tls_private_key.nautilus_rsa.private_key_pem
  filename    = "/home/bob/nautilus-kp.pem"
  file_permission = "0600"
}


Step 5: Initialize Terraform

bash
terraform init
Step 6: Plan the Infrastructure

bash
terraform plan
Step 7: Apply the Configuration

bash
terraform apply
Type yes when prompted to confirm

Step 8: Verify the Creation

bash
# Check private key file
ls -l /home/bob/nautilus-kp.pem

# Verify permissions (should show -rw-------)
ls -la /home/bob/nautilus-kp.pem
Expected Output:
✅ Key pair "nautilus-kp" created in AWS

✅ Private key saved at /home/bob/nautilus-kp.pem

✅ File permissions set to 0600 (owner read/write only)

Security Notes:
The 0600 permission ensures only you can access the private key

Never share or commit the private key to version control

This key will be used for secure EC2 instance access in future labs

Provider.tf vs Main.tf - Simple Explanation
Provider.tf - The "Connection Settings" File
What it does: Defines HOW to connect to your cloud provider (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.)

Think of it like: Your phone's WiFi/cellular settings

Contains:

Which cloud provider to use (AWS)

Connection details (region, endpoints)

Authentication settings

Version information

Main.tf - The "What to Build" File
What it does: Defines WHAT infrastructure to create

Think of it like: Your shopping list or blueprint

Contains:

Resources to create (key pairs, servers, databases)

Configuration of those resources

The actual things you want to build

Real World Analogy:
Provider.tf = Your car keys and driver's license (lets you drive)

Main.tf = Your destination and route (where you want to go)

Why Separate Them:
Organization: Keep connection settings separate from infrastructure

Reusability: Same provider settings can be used for multiple projects

Security: Sensitive connection details are isolated

Team Work: Different people can manage connections vs infrastructure

In Your Case:
provider.tf = "Connect to LocalStack mock AWS on these endpoints"

main.tf = "Create a key pair called nautilus-kp"

This separation makes your code cleaner and more maintainable! 🎯

can we use just one of them just main.tf or just provider?
Yes! You Can Use Just One File
Option 1: Everything in main.tf ✅
You can put both provider configuration AND resources in main.tf:

hcl
# Provider config
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "5.91.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
  # ... other settings
}

# Resources
resource "aws_key_pair" "nautilus_key" {
  key_name   = "nautilus-kp"
  # ...
}
Option 2: Everything in provider.tf ✅
You can put both provider config AND resources in provider.tf:

hcl
# Provider config
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "5.91.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# Resources
resource "aws_key_pair" "nautilus_key" {
  key_name   = "nautilus-kp"
  # ...
}
Key Point:
Terraform reads ALL .tf files in the directory and combines them. The file names don't matter to Terraform - it's just for human organization.

Why We Usually Separate Them:
Small projects: One file is fine

Large projects: Multiple files help organization

Team projects: Different people work on different parts

Best practice: Separate concerns for clarity

Bottom Line:
For your lab, you could have put everything in main.tf and deleted provider.tf, or vice versa! The separation is for human readability, not technical requirements. 🎯
