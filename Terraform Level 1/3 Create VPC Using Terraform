3 Create VPC Using Terraform:

The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units. This granular approach enables the team to execute the migration in gradual phases, ensuring smoother implementation and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations. By breaking down the migration into smaller tasks, the Nautilus DevOps team can systematically progress through each stage, allowing for better control, risk mitigation, and optimization of resources throughout the migration process.

Create a VPC named nautilus-vpc in region us-east-1 with any IPv4 CIDR block through terraform.

The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to accomplish this task.

Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.


SOLUTION:

Lab 3: Create VPC Using Terraform
Simple Explanation
This lab teaches you to create a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), which is your own private network space in AWS. Think of it as your own isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can deploy resources securely.

Key Terms
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Your own isolated network in AWS

CIDR Block: IP address range for your VPC (like 10.0.0.0/16)

IPv4: Internet Protocol version 4 (standard IP addresses)

Region: Geographic location where AWS resources are deployed

Benefits and Use Cases
Network Isolation: Your resources are separated from others

Custom Networking: Define your own IP ranges and subnets

Security: Control traffic flow between resources

Foundation: Required for most AWS services (EC2, RDS, etc.)

Step-by-Step Solution
Step 1: Open Terminal in VS Code

Right-click in EXPLORER section → "Open in Integrated Terminal"

Step 2: Navigate to Terraform Directory

bash
cd /home/bob/terraform
Step 3: Create/Edit main.tf File
Add this to your main.tf (you can keep previous resources, Terraform will manage all):

hcl
# Create VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "nautilus_vpc" {
  cidr_block       = "10.0.0.0/16"  # Common CIDR for VPCs
  instance_tenancy = "default"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "nautilus-vpc"
  }
}
Step 4: Initialize Terraform (if not already done)

bash
terraform init
Step 5: Plan the Infrastructure

bash
terraform plan
Step 6: Apply the Configuration

bash
terraform apply
Type yes when prompted

Step 7: Verify the VPC Creation

bash
# Check if VPC was created
terraform show

# You can also check with AWS CLI (if configured)
aws ec2 describe-vpcs --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=nautilus-vpc"
What This Creates:
VPC named "nautilus-vpc" in us-east-1 region

CIDR Block: 10.0.0.0/16 (65,536 IP addresses)

Default tenancy: Shared hardware (cheaper than dedicated)

Important Notes:
CIDR Block Choice: 10.0.0.0/16 is common for VPCs (private IP range)

Other CIDR Options: You could use 172.16.0.0/16 or 192.168.0.0/16

No Overlap: Ensure CIDR doesn't overlap with your existing networks

VPC is Foundation: You'll add subnets, route tables, etc., to this VPC in future labs

CIDR Block Examples You Could Use:
10.0.0.0/16 (10.0.0.0 - 10.0.255.255) ← Recommended for this lab

172.16.0.0/16 (172.16.0.0 - 172.16.255.255)

192.168.0.0/16 (192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255)

Real-World Use:
This VPC will be the foundation for:

Subnets (public/private)

EC2 instances

Databases

Load balancers

All other AWS resources in your network
