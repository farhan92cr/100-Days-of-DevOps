16 Create IAM Policy Using Terraform:
 When establishing infrastructure on the AWS cloud, Identity and Access Management (IAM) is among the first and most critical services to configure. IAM facilitates the creation and management of user accounts, groups, roles, policies, and other access controls. The Nautilus DevOps team is currently in the process of configuring these resources and has outlined the following requirements.

Create an IAM policy named iampolicy_rose in us-east-1 region using Terraform. It must allow read-only access to the EC2 console, i.e., this policy must allow users to view all instances, AMIs, and snapshots in the Amazon EC2 console.

The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to accomplish this task.

Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

SOLUTION:

Lab 16: Create IAM Policy Using Terraform
Simple Explanation
This lab teaches you to create an IAM Policy, which is a JSON document that defines permissions for AWS services. Policies specify what actions are allowed or denied on which resources. You're creating a read-only policy for EC2 console access.

Key Terms
IAM Policy: JSON document defining permissions (allow/deny rules)

Policy Document: The actual JSON content of the policy

Actions: AWS API operations (like ec2:DescribeInstances)

Resources: AWS resources the policy applies to (* means all resources)

Effect: Either "Allow" or "Deny"

Benefits and Use Cases
Fine-grained Control: Define exactly what users can/cannot do

Security: Principle of least privilege (only necessary permissions)

Reusability: Policies can be attached to multiple users/groups/roles

Auditability: Clear documentation of permissions

Step-by-Step Solution
Step 1: Open Terminal in VS Code

Right-click in EXPLORER → "Open in Integrated Terminal"

Step 2: Navigate to Terraform Directory

bash
cd /home/bob/terraform
Step 3: Add IAM Policy to main.tf File
Add this IAM policy resource to your existing main.tf:

hcl
# Create IAM Policy for EC2 read-only access
resource "aws_iam_policy" "iampolicy_rose" {
  name        = "iampolicy_rose"
  description = "Policy for read-only access to EC2 console"
  path        = "/"
  
  # Policy document in JSON format
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect = "Allow"
        Action = [
          "ec2:DescribeInstances",
          "ec2:DescribeImages",
          "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
          "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
          "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
          "ec2:DescribeKeyPairs",
          "ec2:DescribeVpcs",
          "ec2:DescribeSubnets",
          "ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones",
          "ec2:DescribeRegions",
          "ec2:DescribeTags",
          "ec2:DescribeInstanceTypes"
        ]
        Resource = "*"
      }
    ]
  })
}

# Optional: Output the policy ARN
output "policy_arn" {
  value = aws_iam_policy.iampolicy_rose.arn
  description = "ARN of the created IAM policy"
}
Step 4: Apply the Configuration

bash
terraform apply
Type yes when prompted

Step 5: Verify the IAM Policy

bash
# Check if policy was created
terraform show | grep -A10 "aws_iam_policy.iampolicy_rose"

# Or use AWS CLI
aws iam get-policy --policy-arn $(terraform output -raw policy_arn)
What This Creates:
IAM Policy named "iampolicy_rose" with read-only EC2 permissions

Policy Document: JSON defining allowed EC2 describe actions

No Attachments: Policy exists but not attached to any user/group/role

Why These Specific Actions:
The EC2 console needs to display:

Instances tab: DescribeInstances, DescribeInstanceTypes

AMIs tab: DescribeImages

Snapshots tab: DescribeSnapshots

Volumes tab: DescribeVolumes

Network/Security tabs: DescribeVpcs, DescribeSubnets, DescribeSecurityGroups

Your Infrastructure Now Has:
✅ Key pairs

✅ Security groups

✅ VPCs

✅ Elastic IP

✅ EC2 instance

✅ AMI

✅ EBS Volume

✅ EBS Snapshot

✅ CloudWatch Alarm

✅ S3 Bucket

✅ IAM User

✅ IAM Group

✅ IAM Policy (read-only EC2 access)
