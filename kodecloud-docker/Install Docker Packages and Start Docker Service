The Nautilus DevOps team aims to containerize various applications following a recent meeting with the application development team. They intend to conduct testing with the following steps:


Install docker-ce and docker compose packages on App Server 3.


Initiate the docker service.service


Step 1: Install Docker CE
First, connect to App Server 3 and install Docker CE:

# Update package index
sudo yum update -y

# Install required dependencies
sudo yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2

# Add Docker repository
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

# Install Docker CE
sudo yum install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io



Step 2: Install Docker Compose
# Download Docker Compose
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Make it executable
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Verify installation
docker-compose --version



Step 3: Start and Enable Docker Service


# Start Docker service
sudo systemctl start docker

# Enable Docker to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable docker

# Verify Docker service status
sudo systemctl status docker



Step 4: Verify Installation

# Check Docker version
docker --version

# Test Docker with a simple container
sudo docker run hello-world



Step 5: Configure User Permissions (Optional but Recommended)

# Add your user to the docker group to run docker without sudo
sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)

# Apply group changes (you may need to logout/login)
newgrp docker

# Verify you can run docker without sudo
docker ps
Complete Verification
Run these commands to confirm everything is working:

# Check Docker service
sudo systemctl is-active docker

# Check Docker version
docker --version

# Check Docker Compose version
docker-compose --version

# List running containers (should be empty initially)
docker ps
Expected Output
If everything is successful, you should see:

Docker service running and enabled

Docker version information

Docker Compose version information

Ability to run containers without errors

The Nautilus DevOps team now has Docker CE and Docker Compose installed and running on App Server 3, ready for containerization testing with various applications.
