The Nautilus DevOps team is testing various Ansible modules on servers in Stratos DC. They're currently focusing on file creation on remote hosts using Ansible. Here are the details:


a. Create an inventory file ~/playbook/inventory on jump host and include all app servers.


b. Create a playbook ~/playbook/playbook.yml to create a blank file /home/nfsdata.txt on all app servers.


c. Set the permissions of the /home/nfsdata.txt file to 0744.


d. Ensure the user/group owner of the /home/nfsdata.txt file is tony on app server 1, steve on app server 2 and banner on app server 3.


Note: Validation will execute the playbook using the command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml, so ensure the playbook functions correctly without any additional arguments.
