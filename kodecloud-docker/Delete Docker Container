A container named kke-container was created by one of the Nautilus project developers on App Server 1. It was solely for testing purposes and now requires deletion. Execute the following task:



Delete the kke-container on App Server 1 in Stratos DC.


Solution:
Step 1: Connect to App Server 1
First, SSH into App Server 1.

Step 2: Check Container Status
Before deletion, verify the container exists and check its status:


# Check if the container exists and its current state
sudo docker ps -a | grep kke-container


Step 3: Stop the Container (If Running)
If the container is currently running, stop it first:

# Stop the container if it's running
sudo docker stop kke-container


Step 4: Delete the Container
# Delete the kke-container
sudo docker rm kke-container


Step 5: Verify Deletion
# Verify the container has been removed
sudo docker ps -a | grep kke-container

# Check all containers to confirm it's gone
sudo docker ps -a
Complete Command Sequence
Here's the complete set of commands to execute:

bash
# Connect to App Server 1 first, then:

# Check container status
sudo docker ps -a | grep kke-container

# Stop the container if running
sudo docker stop kke-container

# Delete the container
sudo docker rm kke-container

# Verify deletion
sudo docker ps -a | grep kke-container && echo "Container still exists" || echo "Container successfully deleted"
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:

bash
# If container doesn't exist, you'll see an error - that's fine
# Force remove if needed (use with caution)
sudo docker rm -f kke-container

# Check if container exists before attempting removal
if sudo docker ps -a | grep -q kke-container; then
    sudo docker rm kke-container
    echo "Container deleted successfully"
else
    echo "Container does not exist"
fi
Expected Outcome
After executing these commands:

The kke-container will be stopped (if it was running)

The container will be completely removed from the system

docker ps -a should no longer show the kke-container

You'll receive confirmation that the container has been deleted

The testing container kke-container has now been successfully deleted from App Server 1 in Stratos DC.
