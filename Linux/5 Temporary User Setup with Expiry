Question:
As part of the temporary assignment to the Nautilus project, a developer named mariyam requires access for a limited duration. To ensure smooth access management, a temporary user account with an expiry date is needed. Here's what you need to do:



Create a user named mariyam on App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. Set the expiry date to 2024-04-15, ensuring the user is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.

SOLUTION:
Step 1: Connect to App Server 1
First, SSH into App Server 1 in the Stratos Datacenter.

Step 2: Create the user with expiry date
Run the following command to create the user with the specified expiry date:

bash
sudo useradd -m -e 2024-04-15 mariyam
Command breakdown:

sudo - Execute with superuser privileges

useradd - Command to create a new user

-m - Create the user's home directory

-e 2024-04-15 - Set account expiry date to April 15, 2024

mariyam - Username in lowercase as required

Step 3: Set a temporary password (optional but recommended)
Set an initial password for the account:

bash
sudo passwd mariyam
You'll be prompted to enter and confirm the new password.

Step 4: Verify the user creation and expiry date
Check that the user was created correctly and the expiry date is set:

bash
sudo chage -l mariyam
This will display account aging information including the expiry date.

Verification
You can also verify the user exists and check basic information:

bash
id mariyam
getent passwd mariyam
The user mariyam has now been created with:

✅ Username in lowercase: mariyam

✅ Expiry date: April 15, 2024

✅ Home directory created

✅ Standard user configuration

The account will automatically expire on 2024-04-15, after which mariyam will no longer be able to access the system, fulfilling the temporary access requirement.
