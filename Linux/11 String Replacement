11 String Replacement:
Within the Stratos DC, the backup server holds template XML files crucial for the Nautilus application. Before utilization, these files require valid data insertion. As part of routine maintenance, system admins at xFusionCorp Industries employ string and file manipulation commands.



Your task is to substitute all occurrences of the string Text with Cloud within the XML file located at /root/nautilus.xml on the backup server.


SOLUTION:
Step 1: Connect to the Backup Server
SSH into the backup server in the Stratos Datacenter:

bash
ssh username@stbkp01
Step 2: Verify the File
First, check the file exists and view its current content:

bash
sudo ls -l /root/nautilus.xml
sudo cat /root/nautilus.xml
Step 3: Replace "Text" with "Cloud"
Use the sed command to perform the string replacement:

bash
sudo sed -i 's/Text/Cloud/g' /root/nautilus.xml
Command breakdown:

sudo - Run with root privileges (file is in /root)

sed - Stream editor for text manipulation

-i - Edit file in-place (modify the original file)

s/Text/Cloud/ - Substitute "Text" with "Cloud"

g - Global replacement (all occurrences in each line)

/root/nautilus.xml - Target file

Step 4: Verify the Changes
Check that the replacements were made correctly:

bash
# View the modified file
sudo cat /root/nautilus.xml

# Or check for occurrences of "Text" (should find none)
sudo grep "Text" /root/nautilus.xml

# Check for "Cloud" (should find replacements)
sudo grep "Cloud" /root/nautilus.xml
Alternative Methods
If you prefer other approaches:

Using perl:

bash
sudo perl -pi -e 's/Text/Cloud/g' /root/nautilus.xml
Using awk:

bash
sudo awk '{gsub(/Text/, "Cloud"); print}' /root/nautilus.xml > /tmp/temp.xml && sudo mv /tmp/temp.xml /root/nautilus.xml
Complete Solution
Here's the complete set of commands:

bash
# Connect to backup server
ssh your_user@stbkp01

# Verify original file
sudo cat /root/nautilus.xml | head -10

# Perform the replacement
sudo sed -i 's/Text/Cloud/g' /root/nautilus.xml

# Verify changes
sudo cat /root/nautilus.xml | head -10
echo "=== Checking for 'Text' (should be empty) ==="
sudo grep "Text" /root/nautilus.xml
echo "=== Checking for 'Cloud' (should show results) ==="
sudo grep "Cloud" /root/nautilus.xml | head -5
Example Before and After
Before:

xml
<config>
  <server>Text Server</server>
  <database>Text Database</database>
  <application>Text App</application>
</config>
After:

xml
<config>
  <server>Cloud Server</server>
  <database>Cloud Database</database>
  <application>Cloud App</application>
</config>
Important Notes
The -i flag directly modifies the file - use carefully!

The g flag ensures ALL occurrences on each line are replaced

We use sudo because the file is in the /root directory

Always verify the changes after replacement

The replacement is now complete! All occurrences of "Text" have been changed to "Cloud" in the /root/nautilus.xml file on the backup server.
