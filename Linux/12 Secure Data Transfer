12 Secure Data Transfer:
A Nautilus developer has stored confidential data on the jump host within Stratos DC. To ensure security and compliance, this data must be transferred to one of the app servers. Given developers lack direct access to these servers, the system admin team has been enlisted for assistance.



Copy /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg file from jump server to App Server 2 placing it in the directory /home/app.


SOLUTION:

Step-by-Step with Detailed Verification
For thorough verification:

bash
# From jump server
ssh your_user@jump_host

# Check source file details
echo "Source file details:"
ls -lh /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg
md5sum /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg

# Transfer the file
scp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg your_user@stapp02:/home/app/

# Verify on destination
ssh your_user@stapp02
echo "Destination file details:"
ls -lh /home/app/nautilus.txt.gpg
md5sum /home/app/nautilus.txt.gpg


Important Notes
Security: The file is already encrypted (.gpg extension), so it's safe for transfer

Authentication: Ensure you have SSH key-based authentication set up between servers

Permissions: The /home/app/ directory must exist and be writable on App Server 2

File Integrity: Always verify the transfer was successful and files are intact

Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:

Permission denied: Check SSH keys and directory permissions

No such file: Verify the source file path

Directory doesn't exist: Create it first: ssh stapp02 "mkdir -p /home/app"

The encrypted file /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg has now been securely transferred from the jump server to App Server 2 and placed in the /home/app/ directory as required.
