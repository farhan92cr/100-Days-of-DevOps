LAB 9:
In a bid to automate backup processes, the xFusionCorp Industries sysadmin team has developed a new bash script named xfusioncorp.sh. While the script has been distributed to all necessary servers, it lacks executable permissions on App Server 3 within the Stratos Datacenter.



Your task is to grant executable permissions to the /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 3. Additionally, ensure that all users have the capability to execute it.



SOLUTION:
Step 1: Connect to App Server 3
SSH into App Server 3 in the Stratos Datacenter:

bash
ssh username@stapp03
Step 2: Check Current Permissions
First, verify the script exists and check its current permissions:

bash
ls -l /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
The output might look something like:

text
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 date /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
This shows the script currently has read-write for owner, and read-only for group and others (no execute permissions).

Step 3: Grant Executable Permissions to All Users
Use the chmod command to add execute permissions for all users (owner, group, and others):

bash
sudo chmod a+x /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
Alternative methods that achieve the same result:

bash
# Method 2: Using numeric notation (recommended)
sudo chmod 755 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

# Method 3: Simple execute permission for all
sudo chmod +x /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
Step 4: Verify the New Permissions
Check that the permissions have been applied correctly:

bash
ls -l /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
Expected Output After Permission Change
You should now see:

text
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 0 date /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
Permission breakdown:

rwx - Owner can read, write, and execute

r-x - Group can read and execute

r-x - Others can read and execute

Step 5: Test Script Execution (Optional)
Verify that the script can be executed:

bash
# Test running the script
/tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
Complete One-Line Solution
The entire task can be completed with this single command:

bash
sudo chmod 755 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
Verification
To thoroughly verify the setup:

bash
# Check detailed permissions
ls -l /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

# Verify with different methods
stat /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh | grep -i access
getfacl /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh 2>/dev/null || ls -l /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
Important Notes
Use sudo since the script is likely owned by root

chmod 755 is the standard permission for executable scripts

The script must have a proper shebang line (like #!/bin/bash) at the top to execute correctly

All users can now execute this script regardless of their privilege level

The /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script now has executable permissions and can be run by any user on App Server 3, enabling the automated backup processes for xFusionCorp Industries.
