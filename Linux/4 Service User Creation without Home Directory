TASK:
In response to the latest tool implementation at xFusionCorp Industries, the system admins require the creation of a service user account. Here are the specifics:



Create a user named john in App Server 1 without a home directory.

Note: You can find the infrastructure details by clicking on the Details of all Users and Servers button on the top-right section of the page.


SOLUTION:
Step-by-Step Solution:
Step 1: Connect to stapp01 server
bash
ssh tony@stapp01
Password: Ir0nM@n

Step 2: Create the user without home directory
bash
sudo useradd -M john
The -M flag tells useradd NOT to create a home directory for the user.

Step 3: Verify the user creation
bash
# Check user details
id john

# Verify no home directory was created
sudo ls -la /home/ | grep john

# Check the user entry in /etc/passwd
grep john /etc/passwd
Step 4: Additional verification (check home directory status)
bash
# Check what the passwd file shows as home directory
getent passwd john | cut -d: -f6

# Try to navigate to the home directory (should fail)
sudo -u john cd ~
echo $?
