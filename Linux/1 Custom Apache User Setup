In response to heightened security concerns, the xFusionCorp 
Industries security team has opted for custom Apache users for 
their web applications. Each user is tailored specifically for 
an application, enhancing security measures. Your task is to 
create a custom Apache user according to the outlined specifications:



a. Create a user named kareem on App server 1 within the 
Stratos Datacenter.


b. Assign a unique UID 1506 and designate the home 
directory as /var/www/kareem.

SOLUTION:

Step 1: Connect to stapp01 server
ssh tony@stapp01
Password: Ir0nM@n

Step 2: Create the user with specified parameters
sudo useradd -u 1506 -d /var/www/kareem -m kareem
Let me explain the flags:

-u 1506: Sets the UID to 1506 as required

-d /var/www/kareem: Sets the home directory to /var/www/kareem

-m: Creates the home directory if it doesn't exist

kareem: The username

Step 3: Verify the user was created correctly
id kareem
This should show output similar to:

uid=1506(kareem) gid=1506(kareem) groups=1506(kareem)


Step 4: Verify the home directory
ls -ld /var/www/kareem
This should confirm the directory exists and is owned by the kareem user.

Step 5: Set a password for the user (optional but recommended)
sudo passwd kareem
You can set a secure password when prompted.

Complete Command Sequence:
bash
# Connect to the server
ssh tony@stapp01

# Create the user with specified parameters
sudo useradd -u 1506 -d /var/www/kareem -m kareem

# Verify the creation
id kareem
ls -ld /var/www/kareem

# Set password (optional)
sudo passwd kareem
This setup creates a dedicated Apache user kareem with UID 1506 and 
home directory /var/www/kareem, which aligns with the security 
requirements of having custom Apache users for web applications. 
The user can now be used to run Apache processes or deploy web 
applications with enhanced security isolation.
