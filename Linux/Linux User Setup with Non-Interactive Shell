Linux User Setup with Non-Interactive Shell:

To accommodate the backup agent tool's specifications, the system admin team at xFusionCorp Industries requires the creation of a user with a non-interactive shell. Here's your task:



Create a user named siva with a non-interactive shell on App Server 1.


SOlUTION:
Understanding Non-Interactive Shell
A non-interactive shell is typically used for system accounts that don't need login capabilities. Common non-interactive shells include:

/bin/false

/sbin/nologin

/usr/sbin/nologin

Step-by-Step Solution:
Step 1: Connect to stapp01 server
bash
ssh tony@stapp01
Password: Ir0nM@n

Step 2: Create the user with non-interactive shell
You have a few options for creating the user:

Option A: Using /bin/false (completely non-interactive)
bash
sudo useradd -s /bin/false siva
Option B: Using /sbin/nologin (shows custom message when login attempted)
bash
sudo useradd -s /sbin/nologin siva
Option C: Using /usr/sbin/nologin (similar to above)
bash
sudo useradd -s /usr/sbin/nologin siva
Step 3: Verify the user creation
bash
# Check user details
id siva

# Verify the shell assignment
grep siva /etc/passwd
Step 4: Test the non-interactive shell (optional verification)
bash
# Try switching to the user (this should fail)
sudo su - siva

# Or test the shell directly
sudo -u siva /bin/false
echo $?
Complete Command Sequence:
bash
# Connect to the server
ssh tony@stapp01

# Create user with non-interactive shell (choose one method)
sudo useradd -s /bin/false siva

# Verify the creation
id siva
grep siva /etc/passwd
Expected Output:
The verification commands should show:

For id siva:

text
uid=1002(siva) gid=1002(siva) groups=1002(siva)
For grep siva /etc/passwd:

text
siva:x:1002:1002::/home/siva:/bin/false
(Note: The UID/GID numbers may vary)

Additional Considerations:
If you want to set a password (optional):
bash
sudo passwd siva
If you need to modify an existing user:
bash
sudo usermod -s /bin/false siva
To check available shells:
bash
cat /etc/shells
Why Use Non-Interactive Shells?
Security: Prevents unauthorized login access

System Accounts: Ideal for service/application accounts

Backup Agents: Common requirement for backup software service accounts

Resource Management: Reduces system resource usage

Recommended Approach:
For backup agent tools, /sbin/nologin or /bin/false are both appropriate choices. /sbin/nologin is often preferred as it provides a polite message when login is attempted, while /bin/false simply exits without any message.

The user siva is now created with a non-interactive shell, making it suitable for the backup agent tool's requirements on App Server 1.
