Question:
The Nautilus development team has initiated a new project development, establishing various Git repositories to manage each project's source code. Recently, a repository named /opt/news.git was created. The team has provided a sample index.html file located on the jump host under the /tmp directory. This repository has been cloned to /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on the storage server in the Stratos DC.



Copy the sample index.html file from the jump host to the storage server placing it within the cloned repository at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news.

Add and commit the file to the repository.

Push the changes to the master branch.


SOLUTION:

Step 1: Copy the file from Jump Host to Storage Server
First, from the Jump Host, copy the file to the Storage Server:

bash
# From Jump Host, copy the file to Storage Server
scp /tmp/index.html natasha@ststor01:/tmp/
Step 2: Connect to Storage Server and Move the File
bash
# Connect to Storage Server
ssh natasha@ststor01

# Move the file to the repository directory
mv /tmp/index.html /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news/
Step 3: Navigate to Repository and Configure Git (if needed)
bash
# Navigate to the repository
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news

# Configure user information (if not already set)
git config --global user.email "jon@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Jon"
Step 4: Add and Commit the File
bash
# Add the file to staging
git add index.html

# Commit the file with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add initial index.html file"
Step 5: Push to Master Branch
bash
# Push the changes to the master branch
git push origin master
Complete Command Sequence:
bash
# 1. From Jump Host - Copy file to Storage Server
scp /tmp/index.html natasha@ststor01:/tmp/

# 2. Connect to Storage Server
ssh natasha@ststor01

# 3. Move file to repository
mv /tmp/index.html /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news/

# 4. Navigate to repository and commit changes
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add initial index.html file"

# 5. Push to master branch
git push origin master
Verification Steps:
After completing the process, verify everything worked:

bash
# Check git status (should be clean)
git status

# Check git log to see the commit
git log --oneline

# Verify the file exists in the repository
ls -la /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news/index.html
Expected Output:
After git status: "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit" or "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

After git log --oneline: You should see your commit with the message "Add initial index.html file"

After git push: Should show successful push message

Troubleshooting:
If you encounter issues:

If git config is not set:

bash
git config --global user.email "jon@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Jon"
If remote origin is not set:

bash
git remote -v
# If not set, add it:
git remote add origin /opt/news.git
If push is rejected:

bash
git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
git push origin master
This process will successfully add the index.html file to the repository and push it to the master branch.
