The Nautilus development team has provided requirements to the DevOps team for a new application development project, specifically requesting the establishment of a Git repository. Follow the instructions below to create the Git repository on the Storage server in the Stratos DC:



Utilize yum to install the git package on the Storage Server.


Create a bare repository named /opt/news.git (ensure exact name usage).


SOLUTION:

What is a Bare Repository?
A bare repository is a Git repository that doesn't have a working directory. It's designed to serve as a central repository that multiple developers can push to and pull from.

Key Differences:
Regular Repository (Non-bare):

Contains the .git folder AND a working directory with actual files

You can make changes, commit, and work directly in it

Structure: /project/.git/ + /project/files/

Bare Repository:

Contains ONLY the .git contents (no working directory)

Used as a central hub/shared repository

Developers cannot work directly in it

Structure: /repo.git/ (contains all Git internals directly)

Visual Comparison:
text
Regular Repository:
/opt/news/
├── .git/           # Git database
│   ├── objects/
│   ├── refs/
│   └── ...
├── file1.txt       # Working files
├── file2.py
└── README.md

Bare Repository:
/opt/news.git/
├── objects/        # Git database (no working files)
├── refs/
├── config
├── HEAD
└── ...
Why Use Bare Repositories?
Central Hub Function: Acts like GitHub/GitLab for your team

Prevents Conflicts: No working directory means no file conflicts when pushing

Standard Practice: This is how shared repositories are typically set up

Push Safety: Git prevents pushing to non-bare repositories to avoid overwriting work


# 1. Connect to Storage Server from jump server
ssh natasha@ststor01
# Password: Bl@kW

# 2. Install Git (may need to switch to root)
sudo yum install git -y

# 3. Create the bare repository
sudo git init --bare /opt/news.git

# 4. Verify the repository structure
sudo ls -la /opt/news.git/

Important Notes:
The repository path must be exactly /opt/news.git

This is a bare repository (no working directory), suitable for use as a central repository that developers can push to and pull from

The repository is now ready for the development team to use as their remote origin

The Git repository has been successfully set up on the Storage Server as requested by the Nautilus development team.
