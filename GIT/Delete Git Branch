Question:
The Nautilus developers are engaged in active development on one of the project repositories located at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/media. During testing, several test branches were created, and now they require cleanup. Here are the requirements provided to the DevOps team:



On the Storage server in Stratos DC, delete a branch named xfusioncorp_media from the /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/media Git repository.

SOLUTION:

Complete Safe Approach:
bash
ssh natasha@ststor01
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/media

# Switch to master/main branch first to ensure we're not on the branch to be deleted
git checkout master

# Delete the branch
git branch -d xfusioncorp_media

# If above fails with "not fully merged" warning, use force delete
git branch -D xfusioncorp_media

# Verify
git branch -a
Expected Output:
Before deletion:

text
* master
  xfusioncorp_media
  other-branches...
After deletion:

text
* master
  other-branches...
The xfusioncorp_media branch should no longer appear in the branch list.

Important Notes:
Make sure you're not currently checked out to the branch you want to delete

Use -d for safe delete (checks if merged)

Use -D for force delete (bypasses merge checks)

If the branch exists on remote, you may need to delete it from both local and remote

This will successfully clean up the test branch as required by the Nautilus development team.
