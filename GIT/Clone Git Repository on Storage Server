The DevOps team established a new Git repository last week, which remains unused at present. However, the Nautilus application development team now requires a copy of this repository on the Storage Server in the Stratos DC. Follow the provided details to clone the repository:



The repository to be cloned is located at /opt/news.git


Clone this Git repository to the /usr/src/kodekloudrepos directory. Perform this task using the natasha user, and ensure that no modifications are made to the repository or existing directories, such as changing permissions or making unauthorized alterations.
Based on our previous analysis, I now understand the correct approach. The repository should be cloned into /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ creating a subdirectory.

Correct Solution:
Step 1: Connect as natasha
ssh natasha@ststor01


Step 2: Ensure the target directory exists and clone
mkdir -p /usr/src/kodekloudrepos
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos
git clone /opt/news.git

*instead of clone "do" copy of new.git to /usr/src/kodeeklodrepos*



Step 3: Verify the clone
ls -la /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news/
Complete Command Sequence:
ssh natasha@ststor01
mkdir -p /usr/src/kodekloudrepos
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos
git clone /opt/news.git
ls -la /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news/
