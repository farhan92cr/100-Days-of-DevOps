âœ… 4 story titles present

âœ… "The Lion and the Mouse" (correct spelling)

âœ… Latest commit shows the fixes

âœ… Final Verification:
bash
# Verify file has exactly 4 stories
cat story-index.txt | wc -l  # Should be 4 lines

# Verify typo is fixed
grep "Mouse" story-index.txt  # Should find "The Lion and the Mouse"

# Verify push success
git log --oneline -n 2
ðŸ“¸ Screenshots Needed:
Terminal: Showing fixed story-index.txt content

Terminal: Successful git push

Gitea UI: Showing corrected file with 4 stories

Gitea UI: Commit history with fix message

The key is ensuring story-index.txt has exactly 4 story titles and the Mooose â†’ Mouse typo is fixed before pushing! ðŸ“–âœ¨

Perfect! I can see the conflict. You need to keep 4 story titles (your version has 4, remote has only 3). Let's resolve this:

Step 1: Resolve the Conflict
Edit the file to keep all 4 stories and remove conflict markers:

bash
# Create the correct version with all 4 stories
cat > story-index.txt << 'EOF'
1. The Lion and the Mouse
2. The Frogs and the Ox
3. The Fox and the Grapes
4. The Donkey and the Dog
EOF
Step 2: Verify the Fix
bash
cat story-index.txt
# Should show 4 stories without any conflict markers
Step 3: Also Fix the "Mooose" Typo (if present)
bash
# Check if "Mooose" appears anywhere
grep -i "mooose" story-index.txt

# If it exists, fix it:
sed -i 's/Mooose/Mouse/g' story-index.txt
Step 4: Mark Conflict as Resolved
bash
git add story-index.txt
Step 5: Complete the Merge
bash
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict - kept all 4 story titles"
Step 6: Push the Changes
bash
git push origin master
Step 7: Final Verification
bash
cat story-index.txt
# Should show exactly 4 stories with correct spelling
git log --oneline -n 3
The conflict happened because:

Your version: Had 4 stories (including "The Donkey and the Dog")

Remote version: Had only 3 stories (missing "The Donkey and the Dog")

You need to keep all 4 stories to meet the requirement! ðŸ“–âœ…



Step 1: Check What Files Have Conflicts
bash
git status
Step 2: View the Conflict in story-index.txt
bash
cat story-index.txt
Step 3: Resolve the Conflicts
Look for conflict markers in the file:

text
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes
=======
Remote changes
>>>>>>> commit-hash
Step 4: Edit the File to Resolve Conflicts
bash
# Edit the file to keep the correct version
# Ensure it has:
# - 4 story titles total
# - "The Lion and the Mouse" (not Mooose)
# Remove all conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)

# Use text editor or sed to fix:
vi story-index.txt
Step 5: Mark Conflicts as Resolved
bash
git add story-index.txt
Step 6: Complete the Merge
bash
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
Step 7: Now Push the Changes
bash
git push origin master
Step 8: Verify Everything is Correct
bash
cat story-index.txt
# Should show 4 story titles with correct spelling
