🎯 Git Conflict Markers - Universal Format:
text
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your local changes
=======
Incoming changes from remote
>>>>>>> commit-hash
💡 How It Works Everywhere:
Always the Same Pattern:
<<<<<<< HEAD - Start of your changes

======= - Separator between your changes vs remote changes

>>>>>>> commit-hash - End of remote changes

Real Example from Your Task:
text
<<<<<<< HEAD
3. The Fox and the Grapes
4. The Donkey and the Dog
=======
3. The Fox and the Grapes
>>>>>>> 6ff7347d080e1eaded2c31a88c27e6f99f5ccd4b
🔧 How to Resolve (Always Same):
Delete the markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)

Keep the content you want (or merge manually)

Save the file

🌍 Works Across:
✅ All operating systems (Linux, Windows, Mac)

✅ All Git clients (command line, VS Code, GitHub Desktop, etc.)

✅ All repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, Bitbucket, etc.)

🚀 Pro Tip:
Most code editors (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.) have built-in conflict resolvers that highlight these sections and provide buttons to "Accept Current/Incoming/Both" changes!

So yes - this format is universal in Git! Once you learn it, you can resolve conflicts anywhere! 🎯
