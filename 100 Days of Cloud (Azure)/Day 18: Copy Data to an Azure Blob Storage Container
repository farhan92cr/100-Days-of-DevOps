Day 18: Copy Data to an Azure Blob Storage Container:

The Nautilus DevOps team is presently immersed in data migrations, transferring data from on-premise storage systems to Azure Blob containers. They have recently received some data that they intend to copy to one of the Blob containers.

A Blob container named devops-blob-16859 already exists in the East US region under the storage account devopsst4104. Copy the file /tmp/devops.txt to the Blob container devops-blob-16859.



Use below given Azure Credentials: (You can run the showcreds command on azure-client host to retrieve these credentials)

Portal URL	https://portal.azure.com
Username	kk_lab_user_main-311e62f62f5d4dbd@azurefreekmlprod.onmicrosoft.com
Password	fF6&t7Ac
Start Time	Sat Dec 13 04:26:06 UTC 2025
End Time	Sat Dec 13 05:26:06 UTC 2025

SOLUTION:
For this task, you'll use a single az storage blob upload command from the Azure CLI to copy a local file to a pre-existing blob container. First, ensure you're in the correct lab environment and logged in.

🚀 Step-by-Step Commands
Run these commands in sequence to complete the task:

Log in to Azure using the provided lab credentials:

bash
az login -u kk_lab_user_main-311e62f62f5d4dbd@azurefreekmlprod.onmicrosoft.com -p "fF6&t7Ac"
Upload the file to the specified storage account and container. The --auth-mode login parameter is the recommended way to authorize data operations in the CLI. To copy a file, use the az storage blob upload command.

bash
az storage blob upload \
    --account-name devopsst4104 \
    --container-name devops-blob-16859 \
    --name devops.txt \
    --file /tmp/devops.txt \
    --auth-mode login
✅ How to Verify the Upload
To confirm the file was copied successfully, you can list the contents of the container:

bash
az storage blob list \
    --account-name devopsst4104 \
    --container-name devops-blob-16859 \
    --auth-mode login \
    --output table
You should see a blob named devops.txt in the output.

Important: The Azure CLI will automatically try to query for a storage account key if you don't specify an authentication method. The command above uses --auth-mode login to authenticate with your Microsoft Entra credentials, which is the method recommended in the official Azure documentation.

I hope this helps you complete Day 18 successfully! If you run into issues with authentication or the command doesn't work as expected, please let me know.
