Day 18: Copy Data to an Azure Blob Storage Container:

The Nautilus DevOps team is presently immersed in data migrations, transferring data from on-premise storage systems to Azure Blob containers. They have recently received some data that they intend to copy to one of the Blob containers.

A Blob container named devops-blob-16859 already exists in the East US region under the storage account devopsst4104. Copy the file /tmp/devops.txt to the Blob container devops-blob-16859.
