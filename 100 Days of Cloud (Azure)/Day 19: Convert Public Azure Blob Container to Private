Day 19: Convert Public Azure Blob Container to Private:
The Nautilus DevOps team has been using Azure Blob Storage to manage their data. Recently, they realized that one of their containers, currently public, needs to be restricted for internal use only. Your task is to convert a public Azure Blob container to private.

Two blob containers named nautilus-container-8154 and nautilus-priv-22102 are available in the East US region within the storage account nautilusst29133. The nautilus-container-8154 is currently public, and nautilus-priv-22102 is private.

1) Convert the blob container nautilus-container-8154 from public to private while leaving nautilus-priv-22102 unchanged.

2) Make sure the access level for nautilus-container-8154 is set to private with no public access.
