Day 16: Create a Private Azure Blob Storage Container:
As part of the data migration process, the Nautilus DevOps team is actively creating several storage containers on Azure. They plan to utilize private Blob containers to store the relevant data. Given the ongoing migration of other infrastructure to Azure, it is logical to consolidate data storage within the Azure environment as well.

Create a new storage account named devopsst3095 and a private Blob container named devops-blob-13395 within the storage account.



Use below given Azure Credentials: (You can run the showcreds command on the azure-client host to retrieve credentials)

SOLUTION:

Simple Explanation of Day 16 Lab
Today you're creating a private cloud storage locker in Azure. Think of it like this:

Storage Account (devopsst3095) = The entire storage building

Blob Container (devobs-blob-13395) = One private locker inside that building

Private = Only people with the right key (credentials) can open it

You're setting up secure cloud storage where you can upload files (like documents, images, backups) that only authorized people can access.

Key Terms Defined
Azure Blob Storage: Azure's object storage service for storing massive amounts of unstructured data (files, images, videos, backups).

Storage Account: A container that groups Azure storage services together. All access to storage goes through this account.

Blob Container: A folder/directory within Blob Storage that holds your files (called "blobs").

Private Container: A container that requires authentication/authorization to access. No anonymous/public access allowed.

Public Access: When files can be accessed by anyone with the URL (like public websites). You're making sure this is disabled.

Why This Lab Is Important & Benefits
🔐 Security First
You're creating private storage by default. This prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data to the internet.

📁 Organized Cloud Storage
You learn how to structure cloud storage:

Storage Account (top level)

Container (like a folder)

Blobs (your actual files)

💼 Real-World Use Cases
Application Data: Store user uploads, profile pictures, documents

Backup Storage: Backup databases, VM disks, configuration files

Log Files: Centralized storage for application logs

Data Lakes: Store large datasets for analytics

Media Files: Host videos/images for apps/websites

⚡ Cloud Benefits
Scalable: Automatically grows as you add more files

Durable: Azure keeps multiple copies (99.999999999% durability)

Accessible: Access files from anywhere via API/URL

Cost-effective: Pay only for what you use

Simple Analogy
Think of Azure Storage like a bank:

Storage Account = The bank building

Container = A safety deposit box

Private Setting = You need a key (credentials) to open it

Files = The valuables you store inside

Today, you're renting a safety deposit box in a secure bank!

What You Just Created
You now have:

✅ A secure storage "building" (devopsst3095)

✅ A private "locker" inside it (devobs-blob-13395)

✅ No public access - files are completely private

This is the foundation for storing any type of data securely in Azure cloud!
