The Nautilus DevOps team is strategically planning the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the Azure cloud. Acknowledging the magnitude of this endeavor, they have chosen to tackle the migration incrementally rather than as a single, massive transition. Their approach involves creating Virtual Networks (VNets) as the initial step, as they will be provisioning various services under different VNets.

Create a Virtual Network (VNet) named nautilus-vnet in the East US region with 192.168.0.0/24 IPv4 CIDR.



Use below given Azure Credentials: (You can run the showcreds command on the azure-client host to retrieve credentials)

SOLUTION:
Simple Explanation of Day 5 Lab
This is very similar to Day 4, but with a specific IP range requirement: 192.168.0.0/24. You're creating a Virtual Network (VNet) with this exact IP address range in the East US region. The main difference from Day 4 is the specific CIDR block you must use.

Step-by-Step Solution (Using Azure CLI)
Step 1: Login to Azure
bash
az login -u kk_lab_user_main-e487c2d31a2b4490@azurefreekmlprod.onmicrosoft.com -p 7rk##d@4
Step 2: Check Existing Resource Groups
bash
az group list --output table
Note down the resource group name (you'll use it in Step 4)

Step 3: Create the Virtual Network with SPECIFIC CIDR
bash
az network vnet create \
  --resource-group <YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> \
  --name nautilus-vnet \
  --location "East US" \
  --address-prefix 192.168.0.0/24
Single line version:

bash
az network vnet create --resource-group <YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --name nautilus-vnet --location "East US" --address-prefix 192.168.0.0/24
Step 4: Verify the VNet was Created Correctly
bash
# Check provisioning state
az network vnet show --resource-group <YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --name nautilus-vnet --query "provisioningState"

# Verify the address space
az network vnet show --resource-group <YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --name nautilus-vnet --query "addressSpace.addressPrefixes"
Step-by-Step Solution (Using Azure UI/Portal)
Step 1: Login to Azure Portal
Go to https://portal.azure.com

Use credentials:

Username: kk_lab_user_main-e487c2d31a2b4490@azurefreekmlprod.onmicrosoft.com

Password: 7rk##d@4

Step 2: Create Virtual Network
Click "Create a resource" (+) → Search "Virtual network" → Click "Create"

Step 3: Fill in Details
Basics tab:

Resource group: Select your existing group

Name: nautilus-vnet

Region: East US

Step 4: Configure IP Addresses (CRITICAL STEP)
IP Addresses tab:

IPv4 address space: Delete the default and enter exactly: 192.168.0.0/24

Important: Use this exact CIDR, not 10.0.0.0/16 like yesterday

Subnet name: default subnet will be created automatically

You can leave the default subnet range (192.168.0.0/24)

Step 5: Review and Create
Click "Review + create"

Wait for validation (green checkmark)

Click "Create"

Step 6: Verify Creation
Go to "Virtual networks" service

Click on "nautilus-vnet"

Verify:

Address space: 192.168.0.0/24

Location: East US

Status: Succeeded

Key Difference from Day 4
Day 4	Day 5
Could use any IPv4 CIDR	Must use specific CIDR: 192.168.0.0/24
Example: 10.0.0.0/16	Must be exactly: 192.168.0.0/24
About the CIDR: 192.168.0.0/24
This provides 256 total IP addresses (192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255)

It's a private IP range (cannot be routed on the public internet)

First IP (192.168.0.0) is network address

Last IP (192.168.0.255) is broadcast address

Usable IPs: 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.254 (254 addresses)

Complete CLI Commands (Example with placeholder):
bash
# 1. Login
az login -u kk_lab_user_main-e487c2d31a2b4490@azurefreekmlprod.onmicrosoft.com -p 7rk##d@4

# 2. Find resource group
az group list --output table
# Output might show: kml_rg_main-xxxxx

# 3. Create VNet (replace YOUR_RG with actual name)
az network vnet create --resource-group YOUR_RG --name nautilus-vnet --location "East US" --address-prefix 192.168.0.0/24

# 4. Verify
az network vnet list --resource-group YOUR_RG --output table
Expected result: You'll see nautilus-vnet with address space 192.168.0.0/24 in East US region.
