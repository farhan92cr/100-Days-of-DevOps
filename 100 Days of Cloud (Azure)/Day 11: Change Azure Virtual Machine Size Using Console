The Nautilus DevOps team is migrating a portion of their infrastructure to Azure. During the migration, they have created several virtual machines (VMs) in different regions. The team has identified one VM that is underutilized and has decided to change its size to optimize resource usage.

1) Change the VM size from Standard_B1s to Standard_B2s for the virtual machine named nautilus-vm.

2) Ensure the VM is in the running state after the size change is complete.
