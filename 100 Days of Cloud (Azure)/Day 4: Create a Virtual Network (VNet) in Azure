The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the Azure cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units. This granular approach enables the team to execute the migration in gradual phases, ensuring smoother implementation and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations.

Create a Virtual Network (VNet) named nautilus-vnet in the East US region with any IPv4 CIDR block.

SOLUTION:

Simple Explanation of the Lab
Today you're creating a Virtual Network (VNet) in Azure. Think of a VNet as your own private, isolated section of the Azure cloud - similar to having your own dedicated network in a data center. It's a fundamental building block for organizing and securing your cloud resources.

Key Terms Defined
Virtual Network (VNet): A logically isolated network in Azure where you can place your VMs, databases, and other resources. It provides isolation and security boundaries.

CIDR Block (Classless Inter-Domain Routing): A method for allocating IP addresses and routing Internet Protocol packets. In simple terms, it defines the range of IP addresses available in your network (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).

East US Region: One of Azure's geographical data center locations in Virginia, USA.

Address Prefix: The IP address range for your VNet (we're using 10.0.0.0/16 which provides 65,536 IP addresses).

Benefits and Use Cases
Why do we use Virtual Networks?

Isolation: Keep your development, testing, and production environments completely separate and secure from each other.

Security: Control traffic flow between subnets and resources using Network Security Groups (NSGs).

Connectivity: Connect your VNet to other VNets, your on-premises datacenter, or the internet.

IP Address Management: Define your own private IP address space that won't conflict with other networks.

Use Cases:

Multi-tier Applications: Create separate subnets for web servers, application servers, and databases within the same VNet.

Hybrid Cloud: Connect your on-premises network to Azure using VPN or ExpressRoute.

Network Segmentation: Isolate different departments or projects within the same subscription.

DMZ Configurations: Create perimeter networks for internet-facing applications.

UI Step-by-Step Solution for Day 4 Lab
Step 1: Login to Azure Portal
Go to https://portal.azure.com

Use credentials:

Username: kk_lab_user_main-ba97d3a7b10b4268@azurefreekmlprod.onmicrosoft.com

Password: xhg#p=5&

Step 2: Navigate to Virtual Networks
In the left sidebar, click "Create a resource" (plus icon)

Search for "Virtual network" in the marketplace

Click "Virtual network" from the results

Click the "Create" button

Step 3: Fill in Basic Details
Project details:

Subscription: Use the default one

Resource group: Select your existing resource group (from the dropdown)

Instance details:

Name: nautilus-vnet

Region: East US

Step 4: Configure IP Addresses
IP Addresses tab:

IPv4 address space: 10.0.0.0/16

This is your CIDR block

You can click "+ Add an IPv4 address space" if you want additional ranges, but just 10.0.0.0/16 is sufficient

Subnets section:

A default subnet will be created automatically (usually 10.0.0.0/24)

You can leave this as is for the lab

Step 5: Review and Create
Click "Review + create" button (blue) at the bottom

Wait for validation to pass (green checkmark)

Click "Create" button to deploy the virtual network

Step 6: Verify Creation
Go to the Azure Portal homepage

Click "All resources" in the left sidebar

Look for "nautilus-vnet" in the list

Or search for "nautilus-vnet" in the top search bar

Alternative Navigation Method:
In the search bar at top, type "Virtual networks"

Click on "Virtual networks" service

Click "+ Create" button

Follow Steps 3-5 above

What You Should See:
Deployment in progress notification

"Your deployment is complete" message (takes 1-2 minutes)

nautilus-vnet appears in your list of resources

Quick Verification in UI:
Go to Virtual networks service

Click on nautilus-vnet

Check that:

Status: Succeeded

Location: East US

Address space: 10.0.0.0/16

The VNet is now ready! This creates the foundational networking for your Azure resources. Let me know if you need help with any specific step in the UI.
