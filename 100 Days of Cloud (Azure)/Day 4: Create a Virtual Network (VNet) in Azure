The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the Azure cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units. This granular approach enables the team to execute the migration in gradual phases, ensuring smoother implementation and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations.

Create a Virtual Network (VNet) named nautilus-vnet in the East US region with any IPv4 CIDR block.

SOLUTION:

Simple Explanation of the Lab
Today you're creating a Virtual Network (VNet) in Azure. Think of a VNet as your own private, isolated section of the Azure cloud - similar to having your own dedicated network in a data center. It's a fundamental building block for organizing and securing your cloud resources.

Key Terms Defined
Virtual Network (VNet): A logically isolated network in Azure where you can place your VMs, databases, and other resources. It provides isolation and security boundaries.

CIDR Block (Classless Inter-Domain Routing): A method for allocating IP addresses and routing Internet Protocol packets. In simple terms, it defines the range of IP addresses available in your network (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).

East US Region: One of Azure's geographical data center locations in Virginia, USA.

Address Prefix: The IP address range for your VNet (we're using 10.0.0.0/16 which provides 65,536 IP addresses).

Benefits and Use Cases
Why do we use Virtual Networks?

Isolation: Keep your development, testing, and production environments completely separate and secure from each other.

Security: Control traffic flow between subnets and resources using Network Security Groups (NSGs).

Connectivity: Connect your VNet to other VNets, your on-premises datacenter, or the internet.

IP Address Management: Define your own private IP address space that won't conflict with other networks.

Use Cases:

Multi-tier Applications: Create separate subnets for web servers, application servers, and databases within the same VNet.

Hybrid Cloud: Connect your on-premises network to Azure using VPN or ExpressRoute.

Network Segmentation: Isolate different departments or projects within the same subscription.

DMZ Configurations: Create perimeter networks for internet-facing applications.
