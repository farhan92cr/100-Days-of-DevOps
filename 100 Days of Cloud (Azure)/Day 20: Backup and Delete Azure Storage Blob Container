Day 20: Backup and Delete Azure Storage Blob Container:

The Nautilus DevOps team is currently engaged in a cleanup process, focusing on removing unnecessary data and services from their Azure environment. As part of the migration process, several resources were created for one-time use only, necessitating a cleanup effort to optimize their Azure environment.
