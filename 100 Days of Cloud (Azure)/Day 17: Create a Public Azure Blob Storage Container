Day 17: Create a Public Azure Blob Storage Container:
As part of the data migration process, the Nautilus DevOps team is actively creating several storage containers on Azure. They plan to utilize public Blob containers to store the relevant data. Given the ongoing migration of other infrastructure to Azure, it is logical to consolidate data storage within the Azure environment as well.

Create a new storage account named datacenterst2395 and a public Blob container named datacenter-blob-27159 within the storage account. Make sure anonymous read access for containers and blobs is enabled.



Use below given Azure Credentials: (You can run the showcreds command on the azure-client host to retrieve credentials)

SOLUTION:

Simple Explanation of Day 17 Lab
Today you're creating a public cloud storage locker in Azure. Think of it like this:

Storage Account (datacenterst2395) = The entire storage building

Blob Container (datacenter-blob-27159) = One public locker inside that building

Public = Anyone with the URL can see the files inside (like public photo albums)

This is the opposite of Day 16! You're setting up cloud storage where files can be accessed by anyone on the internet, perfect for hosting website images, public documents, or downloadable files.
