The Nautilus application development team has shared that they are planning to deploy one newly developed application on Nautilus infra in Stratos DC. The application uses PostgreSQL database, so as a pre-requisite we need to set up PostgreSQL database server as per requirements shared below:



PostgreSQL database server is already installed on the Nautilus database server.


a. Create a database user kodekloud_gem and set its password to GyQkFRVNr3.


b. Create a database kodekloud_db7 and grant full permissions to user kodekloud_gem on this database.


Note: Please do not try to restart PostgreSQL server service.
