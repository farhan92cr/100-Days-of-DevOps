12 Update Deployment and Service in Kubernetes:

An application deployed on the Kubernetes cluster requires an update with new features developed by the Nautilus application development team. The existing setup includes a deployment named nginx-deployment and a service named nginx-service. Below are the necessary changes to be implemented without deleting the deployment and service:


1.) Modify the service nodeport from 30008 to 32165

2.) Change the replicas count from 1 to 5

3.) Update the image from nginx:1.19 to nginx:latest

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is configured to operate with the Kubernetes cluster.

Explanation of the Lab
This lab teaches you how to update live Kubernetes resources without deleting and recreating them. This is essential for zero-downtime updates in production.

Key Concepts:
Live Updates:

What: Modifying running Kubernetes resources without service interruption

Why use it: For rolling updates, configuration changes, scaling in production

Real-world analogy: Like upgrading a car's engine while it's still running

Service NodePort:

What: A way to expose services on specific ports of cluster nodes

Why important: Allows external access to services in the cluster
