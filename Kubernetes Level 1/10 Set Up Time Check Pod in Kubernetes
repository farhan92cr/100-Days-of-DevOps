The Nautilus DevOps team needs a time check pod created in a specific Kubernetes namespace for logging purposes. Initially, it's for testing, but it may be integrated into an existing cluster later. Here's what's required:


Create a pod called time-check in the xfusion namespace. The pod should contain a container named time-check, utilizing the busybox image with the latest tag (specify as busybox:latest).

Create a config map named time-config with the data TIME_FREQ=12 in the same namespace.

Configure the time-check container to execute the command: while true; do date; sleep $TIME_FREQ;done. Ensure the result is written /opt/itadmin/time/time-check.log. Also, add an environmental variable TIME_FREQ in the container, fetching its value from the config map TIME_FREQ key.

Create a volume log-volume and mount it at /opt/itadmin/time within the container.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is configured to operate with the Kubernetes cluster.

Explanation of the Lab
This lab combines multiple Kubernetes concepts: Pods, ConfigMaps, Environment Variables, and Volumes to create a logging application.

New Terms Explained:
ConfigMap:

What: A Kubernetes resource that stores configuration data as key-value pairs

Why use it: To separate configuration from application code

Real-world analogy: Like a settings file that can be changed without rebuilding the app

Volume:

What: Storage that persists beyond the container's lifecycle

Why use it: To store data that needs to survive container restarts

Real-world analogy: Like an external hard drive attached to your computer
