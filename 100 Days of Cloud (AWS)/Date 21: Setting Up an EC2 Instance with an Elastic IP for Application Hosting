Date 21: Setting Up an EC2 Instance with an Elastic IP for Application Hosting:

The Nautilus DevOps Team has received a new request from the Development Team to set up a new EC2 instance. This instance will be used to host a new application that requires a stable IP address. To ensure that the instance has a consistent public IP, an Elastic IP address needs to be associated with it. The instance will be named xfusion-ec2, and the Elastic IP will be named xfusion-eip. This setup will help the Development Team to have a reliable and consistent access point for their application.

Create an EC2 instance named xfusion-ec2 using any linux AMI like ubuntu, the Instance type must be t2.micro and associate an Elastic IP address with this instance, name it as xfusion-eip.


Use below given AWS Credentials: (You can run the showcreds command on aws-client host to retrieve these credentials)

SOLUTION::

🛠️ Step-by-Step Solution: Create EC2 Instance & Associate Elastic IP
This lab combines tasks from previous days. Follow these steps carefully.

Login to the AWS Console

Open a web browser.

Go to: https://065091046589.signin.aws.amazon.com/console?region=us-east-1

Username: kk_labs_user_320056

Password: Z2l0EONbTQPr

Click Sign In. Verify the region in the top right is US East (N. Virginia) / us-east-1.

Part A: Allocate the Elastic IP (xfusion-eip)

In the top search bar, type "EC2" and select it.

In the left sidebar, under "Network & Security", click "Elastic IPs".

Click the orange "Allocate Elastic IP address" button.

On the next screen, click "Allocate" (keep all defaults).

After allocation, check the box next to the new IP in the list.

Click Actions -> Edit tags.

Click "Add tag". For Key, enter Name. For Value, enter xfusion-eip.

Click "Save".

Part B: Launch the EC2 Instance (xfusion-ec2)

From the EC2 dashboard, click the orange "Launch instance" button.

Step 1: Name and tags

In "Name", enter xfusion-ec2.

Step 2: Application and OS Images

Click "Ubuntu". Select an Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS AMI (free tier eligible).

Step 3: Instance type

Select t2.micro (free tier eligible).

Step 4: Key pair

Create new key pair. Name it xfusion-kp. Choose RSA and .pem. Click "Create key pair". IMPORTANT: The .pem file will download. Save it securely.

Step 5: Network settings

Click "Edit".

VPC: Leave as default.

Subnet: Choose any.

Auto-assign Public IP: Enable.

Firewall (Security Groups): Select "Create security group".

Name: xfusion-sg

Description: Security group for xfusion-ec2

Add rule: Type SSH, Source Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0).

Steps 6 & 7: Storage and Advanced

Leave all defaults (8 GiB gp2/3 root volume is fine).

Step 8: Summary

Review details. Click "Launch instance".

Final Launch Step:

Click the blue "View all instances" button. Wait for your instance (xfusion-ec2) to show "2/2 checks passed" under Status checks.

Part C: Associate the Elastic IP

Go back to "Elastic IPs" in the left sidebar.

Check the box next to your Elastic IP named xfusion-eip.

Click Actions -> Associate Elastic IP address.

Resource type: Choose Instance.

Instance: Use the search box and select xfusion-ec2.

Private IP address: It will auto-populate. Leave as is.

Click "Associate".

Verification

Go to "Instances".

Select your xfusion-ec2 instance.

In the Details tab, verify the Public IPv4 address now matches the Elastic IP you allocated and named xfusion-eip.

Task Complete! ✅ You have launched an EC2 instance and associated a static Elastic IP.
