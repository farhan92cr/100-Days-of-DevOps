Date 21: Setting Up an EC2 Instance with an Elastic IP for Application Hosting:

The Nautilus DevOps Team has received a new request from the Development Team to set up a new EC2 instance. This instance will be used to host a new application that requires a stable IP address. To ensure that the instance has a consistent public IP, an Elastic IP address needs to be associated with it. The instance will be named xfusion-ec2, and the Elastic IP will be named xfusion-eip. This setup will help the Development Team to have a reliable and consistent access point for their application.

Create an EC2 instance named xfusion-ec2 using any linux AMI like ubuntu, the Instance type must be t2.micro and associate an Elastic IP address with this instance, name it as xfusion-eip.
