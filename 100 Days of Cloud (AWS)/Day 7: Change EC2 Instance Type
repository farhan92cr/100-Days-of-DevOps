Day 7: Change EC2 Instance Type:


🔄 Day 7 Lab: Changing EC2 Instance Type
📖 Lab Explanation
Today, we're changing an EC2 instance type from t2.micro to t2.nano. This demonstrates AWS's elasticity - you can easily resize instances based on utilization. t2.nano is smaller and cheaper than t2.micro, suitable for underutilized instances.

🔍 Key Terms Defined
Instance Type Change
What: Modifying the hardware configuration of a running EC2 instance

Purpose: Right-sizing resources based on actual usage

Benefit: Cost optimization by matching instance size to workload

t2.nano vs t2.micro
Feature	t2.nano	t2.micro
vCPUs	1	1
Memory	0.5 GiB	1 GiB
Baseline Performance	5%	10%
Burstable	Yes	Yes
Cost	~50% cheaper	Baseline
Status Checks
System Status Check: Physical host health

Instance Status Check: Instance OS and network configuration

Initializing: Instance is still booting/configuring

🚀 Benefits & Why We Change Instance Types
💰 Cost Optimization
Right-sizing: Match resources to actual needs

Cost Savings: t2.nano is cheaper than t2.micro

Flexibility: Scale down during low utilization periods

🔄 Operational Benefits
No Data Loss: Instance storage persists

Quick Change: Usually takes 1-2 minutes

Minimal Downtime: Instance reboots but retains IP/config

🎯 When to Change Instance Types
Underutilized Resources: CPU/memory consistently low

Cost Reduction: Optimize spending

Performance Issues: Need more power (scale up)

Testing: Try different instance types for benchmarking

⚠️ Important Considerations
Instance Stop Required: Must stop instance before changing type

Public IP Change: May lose public IP unless using Elastic IP

Status Checks: Must pass before and after change

🛠️ Step-by-Step Solution
Method: AWS Management Console
Login to AWS Console

bash
# Use the provided credentials:

Region: us-east-1 (VERIFY THIS!)
Navigate to EC2 Dashboard

Go to Services → EC2

In left sidebar, click "Instances"

Verify Instance Status

Find instance named devops-ec2

Check Status Checks column:

Should show "2/2 checks passed"

If "Initializing", wait a few minutes

Note instance state should be "Running"

Stop the Instance

Select devops-ec2 instance

Click Instance state → Stop instance

Confirm in dialog: Click "Stop"

Wait for state to change to "Stopped"

This may take 1-2 minutes

Change Instance Type

With instance still selected (and in Stopped state)

Click Actions → Instance settings → Change instance type

Instance type: Select t2.nano

Click "Apply"

Start the Instance

Select the instance

Click Instance state → Start instance

Wait for state to change to "Running"

Wait for Status Checks to show "2/2 checks passed"

Verify the Change

Select the instance

Check Details tab

Instance type should now show t2.nano

Instance state should be "Running"

📋 What We Changed
Instance: devops-ec2

Old Type: t2.micro

New Type: t2.nano

Memory Reduced: 1 GiB → 0.5 GiB

Cost: Approximately 50% reduction

🔧 Alternative Method: AWS CLI
bash
# Stop instance
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-xxxxxxxx

# Change instance type
aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute \
  --instance-id i-xxxxxxxx \
  --instance-type "t2.nano"

# Start instance
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-xxxxxxxx
⚠️ Important Notes
Stopping Required: Cannot change type while instance is running

Public IP: May get new public IP unless using Elastic IP

Elastic IP: If attached, it remains after change

Downtime: ~2-5 minutes during stop/start cycle

Data Persistence: EBS volumes retain data

💰 Cost Impact
t2.micro: ~$0.0116/hour ($8.50/month)

t2.nano: ~$0.0058/hour ($4.25/month)

Savings: ~50% reduction in compute costs

🎉 Congratulations!
You've completed Day 7! You've successfully optimized costs by right-sizing an EC2 instance. This is a crucial skill for managing cloud resources efficiently.

Tomorrow's Preview: We'll likely work with instance storage or networking! 🚀
