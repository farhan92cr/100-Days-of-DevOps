The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units. This granular approach enables the team to execute the migration in gradual phases, ensuring smoother implementation and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations. By breaking down the migration into smaller tasks, the Nautilus DevOps team can systematically progress through each stage, allowing for better control, risk mitigation, and optimization of resources throughout the migration process.

For this task, allocate an Elastic IP address, name it as nautilus-eip.



Use below given AWS Credentials: (You can run the showcreds command on aws-client host to retrieve these credentials)

Notes:

Create the resources only in us-east-1 region.

🌐 Day 4 Lab: Allocating an Elastic IP Address
📖 Lab Explanation
Today, we're allocating an Elastic IP Address - a static, public IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. Unlike regular public IPs that change when you stop/start instances, Elastic IPs remain constant.

🔍 Key Terms Defined
Elastic IP (EIP)
What: A static, public IPv4 address that you can allocate to your AWS account

Purpose: Provides a consistent public IP address that doesn't change

Key Feature: Can be remapped between different EC2 instances

Public IP vs Elastic IP
Public IP: Dynamic, changes when instance stops/starts

Elastic IP: Static, persists until you release it

IP Address Allocation
What: The process of reserving an IP address from AWS's pool

Scope: Regional - allocated to a specific AWS region

🚀 Benefits & Why We Use Elastic IPs
🔧 Technical Advantages
Static Addressing - consistent IP for DNS records, firewalls, etc.

High Availability - quickly remap to backup instances during failures

No DNS Propagation - immediate failover without DNS changes

💡 Practical Benefits
Service Continuity - maintain same IP even if instance changes

SSL Certificates - required for SSL/TLS certificates that bind to IP

Whitelisting - easy firewall/security group configuration

🎯 Use Cases
Web Servers - consistent public facing IP

VPN Servers - static IP for remote access

Database Access - whitelisted IP for external connections

Disaster Recovery - quick failover to backup systems

⚠️ Important Considerations
Cost: Free when attached to running instance, charges apply when unused

Limit: 5 Elastic IPs per region by default (can be increased)

Association: Must be associated with an EC2 instance or other resource

🛠️ Step-by-Step Solution
Method: AWS Management Console
Login to AWS Console

bash
# Use the provided credentials:
URL: https://386532143645.signin.aws.amazon.com/console?region=us-east-1
Username: kk_labs_user_244282
Password: 6MMFt@4tPYjR
Region: us-east-1 (VERIFY THIS!)
Navigate to EC2 Service

Go to Services → EC2

In left sidebar, find "Network & Security" → "Elastic IPs"

Allocate Elastic IP Address

Click "Allocate Elastic IP address"

Network border group: Keep default (us-east-1)

Public IPv4 address pool: Amazon's pool (default)

Tags (Optional but recommended):

Key: Name

Value: nautilus-eip

Click "Allocate"

Verify Allocation

You should see the new Elastic IP in the list

Note the allocated IP address (e.g., 54.210.132.105)

Status should show as "available"

Add Name Tag (if not done during creation)

Select the Elastic IP

Click "Actions" → "Add/edit tags"

Add tag: Key=Name, Value=nautilus-eip

Click "Save"

📋 What We Created
Resource: Elastic IP Address

Name: nautilus-eip

Status: Available (not yet associated with any instance)

Scope: us-east-1 region

🔧 Next Steps
This Elastic IP is now ready to be associated with:

EC2 instances

NAT gateways

Network interfaces

💰 Cost Reminder
Free: When associated with a running instance

Charged: When allocated but not associated ($0.005/hour)

Best Practice: Only allocate when needed, release when done

🎉 Congratulations!
You've completed Day 4! You now have a static public IP address ready for use with EC2 instances or other AWS resources that require consistent public addressing.

Tomorrow's Preview: We'll likely associate this EIP with an EC2 instance! 🚀
