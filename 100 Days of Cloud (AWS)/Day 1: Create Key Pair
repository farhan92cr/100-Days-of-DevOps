The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units. This granular approach enables the team to execute the migration in gradual phases, ensuring smoother implementation and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations. By breaking down the migration into smaller tasks, the Nautilus DevOps team can systematically progress through each stage, allowing for better control, risk mitigation, and optimization of resources throughout the migration process.

For this task, create a key pair with the following requirements:

Name of the key pair should be datacenter-kp.

Key pair type must be rsa



Use below given AWS Credentials: (You can run the showcreds command on aws-client host to retrieve these credentials)

🔐 Day 1 Lab: Creating an AWS Key Pair
📖 Lab Explanation
This lab introduces you to creating an AWS Key Pair, which is your first step in working with AWS EC2 instances. Think of it as creating a secure digital key to access your cloud servers.

🔍 Key Terms Defined
Key Pair
What: A security credential consisting of two parts:

Public Key: Stored by AWS

Private Key: You download and keep secure

Purpose: Used instead of passwords for secure SSH access to EC2 instances

RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)
What: A widely used encryption algorithm

Purpose: Creates mathematically linked public and private keys

Alternative: ED25519 (newer, more efficient)

🚀 Benefits & Why We Use Key Pairs
🔒 Security Advantages
More Secure than passwords (resistant to brute-force attacks)

No Password Sharing - private key never leaves your computer

Automatic Encryption - all communication is encrypted

💡 Practical Benefits
Required for SSH access to EC2 Linux instances

One-time Setup - create once, use for multiple instances

Easy Management - can be reused across instances

🎯 Use Cases
SSH Access to EC2 instances

Secure File Transfers

Automated Scripts accessing cloud resources

Disaster Recovery - having backup keys for critical instances

🛠️ Step-by-Step Solution
Method 1: AWS Management Console
Login to AWS Console

bash
# Use the provided credentials:
URL: https://527862500710.signin.aws.amazon.com/console?region=us-east-1
Username: kk_labs_user_572769
Password: Tr@%rIDRx1t7
Navigate to EC2 Service

Go to Services → EC2

In left sidebar, find "Network & Security" → "Key Pairs"

Create Key Pair

Click "Create key pair"

Name: datacenter-kp

Key pair type: RSA

Private key file format: .pem (for Linux/Mac) or .ppk (for Windows/PuTTY)

Click "Create key pair"

Download & Secure

The private key will automatically download

Important: Store it securely - you can't download it again!

Set proper permissions: chmod 400 datacenter-kp.pem

Method 2: AWS CLI (Alternative)
bash
aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name datacenter-kp --key-type rsa --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text > datacenter-kp.pem
⚠️ Important Notes
Keep Private Key Safe - Never share or lose it!

Backup - Store in multiple secure locations

Permissions - Set file permissions to read-only for owner

🎉 Congratulations!
You've completed Day 1! You now have a secure key to access AWS EC2 instances. This foundational skill will be used throughout your AWS journey.

Ready for Day 2? 🚀
