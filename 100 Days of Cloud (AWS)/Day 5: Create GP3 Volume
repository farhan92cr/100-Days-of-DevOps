The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units. This granular approach enables the team to execute the migration in gradual phases, ensuring smoother implementation and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations. By breaking down the migration into smaller tasks, the Nautilus DevOps team can systematically progress through each stage, allowing for better control, risk mitigation, and optimization of resources throughout the migration process.

Create a volume with the following requirements:

Name of the volume should be xfusion-volume.

Volume type must be gp3.

Volume size must be 2 GiB.

💾 Day 5 Lab: Creating a GP3 EBS Volume
📖 Lab Explanation
Today, we're creating an EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume - a persistent block storage device for EC2 instances. Specifically, we're creating a GP3 volume, which is AWS's latest generation of general-purpose SSD storage.

🔍 Key Terms Defined
EBS (Elastic Block Store)
What: Persistent block-level storage volumes for EC2 instances

Purpose: Provides durable, network-attached storage

Persistence: Data persists independently from instance lifecycle

GP3 Volume Type
What: General Purpose SSD volume (3rd generation)

Features:

Baseline performance: 3,000 IOPS, 125 MB/s throughput

Cost-effective: Separates storage, IOPS, and throughput pricing

Modern: Successor to GP2 volumes

GiB (Gibibyte)
What: 2^30 bytes = 1,073,741,824 bytes

vs GB: GiB is binary-based, GB is decimal-based (AWS uses GiB)

🚀 Benefits & Why We Use EBS Volumes
🔧 Technical Advantages
Persistence: Data remains after instance termination

Snapshots: Create point-in-time backups

Encryption: Built-in AES-256 encryption

Flexibility: Resize without downtime (with some limitations)

💡 GP3 Specific Benefits
Cost Savings: 20% cheaper than GP2 for same storage

Performance Control: Independent IOPS and throughput scaling

Consistent Performance: Baseline performance without bursting

🎯 Use Cases
Boot Volumes: For EC2 instance operating systems

Application Storage: Database files, application data

Data Processing: Temporary storage for data processing

Backup Storage: Target for backup and recovery

⚖️ Volume Type Comparison
Type	Best For	Performance	Cost
gp3	General purpose workloads	3K-16K IOPS, 125-1000 MB/s	💰💰
gp2	Legacy workloads	3K-16K IOPS, 128 MB/s max	💰💰💰
io1/io2	Critical databases	Up to 256K IOPS	💰💰💰💰
st1	Big data, data warehouses	500 MB/s max	💰💰
sc1	Cold data, archives	250 MB/s max	💰
🛠️ Step-by-Step Solution
Method: AWS Management Console
Login to AWS Console

bash
# Use the provided credentials:
URL: https://588840379073.signin.aws.amazon.com/console?region=us-east-1
Username: kk_labs_user_955199
Password: RiP0^@3lW%B2
Region: us-east-1 (VERIFY THIS!)
Navigate to EC2 Service

Go to Services → EC2

In left sidebar, find "Elastic Block Store" → "Volumes"

Create Volume

Click "Create volume"

Volume settings:

Volume type: General Purpose SSD (gp3)

Size: 2 GiB

IOPS: Leave default (3000) or set minimum 3000

Throughput: Leave default (125) or set minimum 125 MB/s

Availability Zone: Choose any AZ in us-east-1 (e.g., us-east-1a)

Snapshot ID: Leave blank (creating new empty volume)

Volume encryption: Optional (disabled by default)

Add Tags

Click "Add tag"

Key: Name

Value: xfusion-volume

(Optional: Add more tags like Environment, Project, etc.)

Create and Verify

Click "Create volume"

You'll see "Successfully created volume"

Click "View volumes" to see it in list

Status should show as "available"

📋 What We Created
Name: xfusion-volume

Type: gp3 (General Purpose SSD)

Size: 2 GiB

Status: Available (not attached to any instance)

Location: us-east-1 availability zone

🔧 Next Steps
This volume can now be:

Attached to an EC2 instance in the same AZ

Used as a data disk (not boot volume in this case)

Encrypted later if needed (cannot encrypt after creation)

⚠️ Important Notes
AZ Locked: Can only attach to instances in same Availability Zone

Attachment: Must be attached to an instance to be used

File System: Need to create file system after attachment (mkfs)

Mounting: Need to mount to a directory after file system creation

🎉 Congratulations!
You've completed Day 5! You now have persistent block storage ready for use with EC2 instances. GP3 volumes provide the best price-performance ratio for most workloads.

Tomorrow's Preview: We'll likely create an EC2 instance and start attaching our resources! 🚀
