As part of the migration, there were some components created under the AWS account. The Nautilus DevOps team created one EC2 instance where they forgot to enable the termination protection which is needed for this instance.

An instance named devops-ec2 already exists in us-east-1 region. Enable termination protection for the same.



Use below given AWS Credentials: (You can run the showcreds command on aws-client host to retrieve these credentials)

Notes:

Create the resources only in us-east-1 region.

SOLuRION:


🛡️ Enabling Termination Protection for EC2 Instance
📖 Lab Explanation
We're enabling Termination Protection for an existing EC2 instance (devops-ec2). This is the exact same concept as Day 8, but now applying it to a different instance. Termination protection prevents accidental stopping or termination of critical instances.

🔍 Quick Recap: Key Terms
Termination Protection
What: Safety feature preventing accidental stop/termination

Also Called: Stop Protection (same feature)

AWS Term: "Disable API termination" attribute

🚀 Why This Matters
Human Error Prevention: Stops accidental "oops" moments

Production Safety: Critical for live systems

Change Control: Enforces proper change procedures

🛠️ Step-by-Step Solution
Method: AWS Management Console
Login to AWS Console

bash
# Use the provided credentials:
URL: https://903068777644.signin.aws.amazon.com/console?region=us-east-1
Username: kk_labs_user_152580
Password: SW5X!AVi7jEx
Region: us-east-1 (VERIFY THIS!)
Navigate to EC2 Dashboard

Go to Services → EC2

In left sidebar, click "Instances"

Locate the Instance

Find instance named devops-ec2

Use search/filter if needed

Verify region is us-east-1

Enable Termination Protection

Select the devops-ec2 instance

Click Actions → Instance settings → Change termination protection

Check "Enable"

Click "Save"

Verify Protection

Select the instance

Check Details tab

Termination protection: Should show Enabled

📋 What We Configured
Instance: devops-ec2

Feature: Termination Protection Enabled

Effect: Cannot be stopped or terminated without disabling first

🔧 Quick CLI Method
bash
# One-liner to enable protection
aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute \
  --instance-id $(aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=devops-ec2" \
    --query "Reservations[0].Instances[0].InstanceId" \
    --output text) \
  --disable-api-termination "{\"Value\": true}"
⚠️ Important Reminders
Not Foolproof: Authorized users can still disable it

Charges Continue: Instance still incurs costs

Backup Still Needed: Protection ≠ backup strategy

✅ Verification Steps
Try to stop instance → Should fail with error

Try to terminate instance → Should fail with error

Both require disabling protection first

🎉 Done!
Termination protection is now enabled for devops-ec2. This instance is now protected from accidental shutdowns or deletions.
