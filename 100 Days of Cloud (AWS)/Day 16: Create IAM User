Day 16: Create IAM User:

When establishing infrastructure on the AWS cloud, Identity and Access Management (IAM) is among the first and most critical services to configure. IAM facilitates the creation and management of user accounts, groups, roles, policies, and other access controls. The Nautilus DevOps team is currently in the process of configuring these resources and has outlined the following requirements:

For this task, create an IAM user named iamuser_jim.



Use below given AWS Credentials: (You can run the showcreds command on aws-client host to retrieve these credentials)

Console URL	https://178729889921.signin.aws.amazon.com/console?region=us-east-1
Username	kk_labs_user_251586
Password	pJfMgG!2ppCY
Start Time	Thu Dec 11 06:06:23 UTC 2025
End Time	Thu Dec 11 07:06:23 UTC 2025

Notes:

Create the resources only in us-east-1 region.

SOLUTION:

For Day 16, your task is to create a basic IAM user. While the requirement is straightforward, it's important to understand that creating IAM users with long-term credentials is not the modern AWS security best practice. The preferred method for human users is to use federation with an identity provider to access AWS with temporary credentials.

However, for this lab task, here is a step-by-step guide to create the IAM user iamuser_jim via the AWS Management Console.
