Day 16: Create IAM User:

When establishing infrastructure on the AWS cloud, Identity and Access Management (IAM) is among the first and most critical services to configure. IAM facilitates the creation and management of user accounts, groups, roles, policies, and other access controls. The Nautilus DevOps team is currently in the process of configuring these resources and has outlined the following requirements:

For this task, create an IAM user named iamuser_jim.



Use below given AWS Credentials: (You can run the showcreds command on aws-client host to retrieve these credentials)

Console URL	https://178729889921.signin.aws.amazon.com/console?region=us-east-1
Username	kk_labs_user_251586
Password	pJfMgG!2ppCY
Start Time	Thu Dec 11 06:06:23 UTC 2025
End Time	Thu Dec 11 07:06:23 UTC 2025

Notes:

Create the resources only in us-east-1 region.

SOLUTION:

For Day 16, your task is to create a basic IAM user. While the requirement is straightforward, it's important to understand that creating IAM users with long-term credentials is not the modern AWS security best practice. The preferred method for human users is to use federation with an identity provider to access AWS with temporary credentials.

However, for this lab task, here is a step-by-step guide to create the IAM user iamuser_jim via the AWS Management Console.

🛠️ Step-by-Step Solution for Day 16: Create IAM User (iamuser_jim)
Follow these exact steps in order:

Login to the AWS Console

Open a web browser.

Go to the provided Console URL: https://178729889921.signin.aws.amazon.com/console?region=us-east-1

Enter the provided credentials:

Username: kk_labs_user_251586

Password: pJfMgG!2ppCY

Click Sign In.

Navigate to the IAM Service

Once logged in, you will be at the AWS Management Console home.

At the top of the screen, use the search bar and type "IAM".

Click on the "IAM" service that appears in the results.

Go to the Users Page

In the left-hand navigation menu, find and click on "Users" (under "Access management").

Start Creating the New User

On the Users page, click the bright orange button: "Create user".

Step 1: Specify User Details

In the "User name" box, type exactly: iamuser_jim.

IMPORTANT FOR THIS LAB: You do not need to check any boxes under "Select AWS credential type." Leave both "Provide user access to the AWS Management Console" and "Access key - Programmatic access" unchecked.

Click the blue "Next" button at the bottom.

Step 2: Set Permissions (Skip This Step)

On the "Set permissions" page, you will not add any permissions. This is correct for this task.

Simply click the blue "Next" button again.

Step 3: Review and Create

You will see a review page. Double-check that the "User name" is iamuser_jim.

Scroll to the bottom and click the orange "Create user" button.

Verification (Final Step)

You will see a green success banner saying "The user iamuser_jim was created successfully."

You will be taken to a list of all users. Verify that iamuser_jim appears in the list with an "Access key ID" column showing "None" (because you did not create credentials).

Task Complete! ✅ You have successfully created the IAM user iamuser_jim with no permissions (which is correct for this lab).
