Day 19: Attach IAM Policy to IAM User:
The Nautilus DevOps team has been creating a couple of services on AWS cloud. They have been breaking down the migration into smaller tasks, allowing for better control, risk mitigation, and optimization of resources throughout the migration process. Recently they came up with requirements mentioned below.

An IAM user named iamuser_rose and a policy named iampolicy_rose already exist. Attach the IAM policy iampolicy_rose to the IAM user iamuser_rose.



Use below given AWS Credentials: (You can run the showcreds command on aws-client host to retrieve these credentials)

Console URL	https://067458473202.signin.aws.amazon.com/console?region=us-east-1

Password	bXAHs1PhXivi
