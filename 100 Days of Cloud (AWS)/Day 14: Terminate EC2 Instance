Day 14: Terminate EC2 Instance:

During the migration process, several resources were created under the AWS account. Later on, some of these resources became obsolete as alternative solutions were implemented. Similarly, there is an instance that needs to be deleted as it is no longer in use.

1) Delete the ec2 instance named xfusion-ec2 present in us-east-1 region.

2) Before submitting your task, make sure instance is in terminated state.
