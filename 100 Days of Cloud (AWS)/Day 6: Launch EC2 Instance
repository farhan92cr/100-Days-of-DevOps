Day 6: Launch EC2 Instance:
The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units.

For this task, create an EC2 instance with following requirements:

1) The name of the instance must be devops-ec2.

2) You can use the Amazon Linux AMI to launch this instance.

3) The Instance type must be t2.micro.

4) Create a new RSA key pair named devops-kp.

5) Attach the default (available by default) security group.



Use below given AWS Credentials: (You can run the showcreds command on aws-client host to retrieve these credentials)

Console URL	https://277968024163.signin.aws.amazon.com/console?region=us-east-1

Start Time	Tue Dec 02 05:18:22 UTC 2025
End Time	Tue Dec 02 06:18:22 UTC 2025




Notes:

Create the instance in us-east-1 region.

🖥️ Day 6 Lab: Launching an EC2 Instance
📖 Lab Explanation
Today, we're launching an EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) Instance - a virtual server in AWS cloud. This is the core compute service where we'll run our applications. We're creating a t2.micro instance, which is free-tier eligible.

🔍 Key Terms Defined
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
What: Virtual servers in the cloud

Purpose: Provides resizable compute capacity

Flexibility: Can scale up/down based on demand

AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
What: Pre-configured virtual machine template

Contains: OS, application server, applications

Amazon Linux AMI: AWS-optimized Linux distribution

t2.micro Instance Type
Family: Burstable performance instances

vCPUs: 1 virtual CPU

Memory: 1 GiB

Free Tier: Eligible (750 hours/month free for 12 months)

Key Pair
What: SSH key for secure instance access

RSA: Encryption algorithm for key generation

🚀 Benefits & Why We Use EC2
🔧 Technical Advantages
Scalability: Launch instances in minutes, scale as needed

Flexibility: Choose OS, instance type, storage, networking

Control: Root/administrator access to instances

Integration: Works with other AWS services

💡 Business Benefits
Cost Effective: Pay only for what you use

Reliable: 99.99% availability SLA

Secure: Built-in security features and compliance

🎯 Use Cases
Web Applications: Host websites and web apps

Development/Test: Sandbox environments

Batch Processing: Data processing workloads

Enterprise Applications: Run business applications

🛠️ Step-by-Step Solution
Method: AWS Management Console
Login to AWS Console

bash
# Use the provided credentials:
URL: https://277968024163.signin.aws.amazon.com/console?region=us-east-1
Username: kk_labs_user_351521
Password: P^8^Sz!gS%qT
Region: us-east-1 (VERIFY THIS!)
Navigate to EC2 Dashboard

Go to Services → EC2

Click "Launch instance" button

Step 1: Name and Tags

Name: devops-ec2

(Optional: Add more tags)

Step 2: Application and OS Images

Quick Start: Amazon Linux

AMI: Select "Amazon Linux 2 AMI" or "Amazon Linux 2023 AMI"

Architecture: 64-bit (x86)

Step 3: Instance Type

Select t2.micro (Free tier eligible)

Click "Next: Configure Instance Details"

Step 4: Configure Instance Details

Number of instances: 1

Network: Default VPC

Subnet: Any default subnet

Leave other settings as default

Click "Next: Add Storage"

Step 5: Add Storage

Root volume: Keep default (8 GB gp2/gp3)

Click "Next: Add Tags"

Step 6: Add Tags (Optional - already named in Step 1)

Verify Name tag: devops-ec2

Click "Next: Configure Security Group"

Step 7: Configure Security Group

Assign a security group: Select existing security group

Choose default security group (usually named "default")

Description: Default security group

Click "Review and Launch"

Step 8: Review Instance Launch

Review all settings

Click "Launch"

Key Pair Dialog

Create a new key pair

Key pair name: devops-kp

Key pair type: RSA

Private key file format: .pem (for Linux/Mac)

Download Key Pair: Click "Download Key Pair"

IMPORTANT: Save the .pem file securely

Check "I acknowledge..."

Click "Launch Instances"

Success Message

Click "View all instances"

Instance will show "pending" then "running"

📋 What We Created
Instance Name: devops-ec2

AMI: Amazon Linux

Instance Type: t2.micro

Key Pair: devops-kp (downloaded)

Security Group: Default

Status: Running

🔑 Important: Key Pair Security
text
# Set proper permissions for the key
chmod 400 devops-kp.pem

# SSH to instance (when public IP known)
ssh -i devops-kp.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
📊 Instance Details to Note
Public IP: Assigned automatically (changes on stop/start)

Private IP: Internal network IP

Instance ID: e.g., i-0abcdef1234567890

State: Running

⚠️ Important Notes
Free Tier: t2.micro is free-tier eligible

Cost: Will incur charges if running beyond free tier limits

Security: Default security group may need stricter rules for production

Access: Use ec2-user username for Amazon Linux

🎉 Congratulations!
You've completed Day 6! You now have a running EC2 instance in AWS. This is a fundamental building block for cloud infrastructure.

Tomorrow's Preview: We'll likely connect to this instance and configure it! 🚀
