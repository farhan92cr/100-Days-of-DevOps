The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition.

For this task, create one subnet named devops-subnet under default VPC.



Use below given AWS Credentials: (You can run the showcreds command on aws-client host to retrieve these credentials)

Console URL	https://718633645857.signin.aws.amazon.com/console?region=us-east-1
Username	kk_labs_user_569830
Password	IxO5LELm@IiA
Start Time	Fri Nov 28 06:57:00 UTC 2025
End Time	Fri Nov 28 07:57:00 UTC 2025

Notes:

Create the resources only in us-east-1 region.

🌐 Day 3 Lab: Creating an AWS Subnet
📖 Lab Explanation
Today, we're creating a Subnet - which is a range of IP addresses in your VPC where you can place groups of isolated resources. Think of it as creating a neighborhood within your city (VPC) where you can build houses (EC2 instances).

🔍 Key Terms Defined
Subnet
What: A segment of a VPC's IP address range where you can launch AWS resources

Purpose: Isolate resources and control network traffic between them

Types:

Public Subnet - has route to internet gateway

Private Subnet - no direct internet access

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
What: Your own isolated virtual network in AWS

Default VPC: Automatically created in each AWS region

CIDR Block: Typically 172.31.0.0/16 for default VPC

CIDR Block
What: Defines the range of IP addresses for your subnet

Example: 172.31.0.0/20 means 172.31.0.1 - 172.31.15.254

Availability Zone
What: Isolated locations within an AWS region

Purpose: Provides high availability and fault tolerance

🚀 Benefits & Why We Use Subnets
🔒 Security Advantages
Network Segmentation - isolate different types of resources

Access Control - different security groups per subnet

Traffic Control - route tables control traffic flow

💡 Practical Benefits
High Availability - spread resources across multiple AZs

Cost Optimization - use smaller subnets to save IP space

Performance - reduce network congestion through segmentation

🎯 Use Cases
Web Tier - public subnets for web servers

Application Tier - private subnets for app servers

Database Tier - highly restricted private subnets

Multi-AZ Deployment - subnets in different AZs for redundancy

🛠️ Step-by-Step Solution
Method: AWS Management Console
Login to AWS Console

bash
# Use the provided credentials:
URL: https://718633645857.signin.aws.amazon.com/console?region=us-east-1
Username: kk_labs_user_569830
Password: IxO5LELm@IiA
Region: us-east-1 (VERIFY THIS!)
Navigate to VPC Service

Go to Services → VPC

In left sidebar, find "Virtual Private Cloud" → "Subnets"

Create Subnet

Click "Create subnet"

Subnet settings:

VPC ID: Select default VPC (vpc-xxxxxxxxx)

Subnet name: devops-subnet

Availability Zone: Choose any AZ (e.g., us-east-1a)

IPv4 CIDR block: Choose an available range from default VPC

Determine Available CIDR Block

Check existing subnets in default VPC

Default VPC typically uses 172.31.0.0/16

Common available ranges: 172.31.16.0/20, 172.31.32.0/20, etc.

Select a /20 block that doesn't overlap with existing subnets

Create and Verify

Click "Create subnet"

Verify the subnet appears in the list with name devops-subnet

Note the subnet ID for future use

📋 What We Created
Name: devops-subnet

VPC: Default VPC

Type: Will be public (default VPC subnets have internet access)

CIDR Block: /20 block within 172.31.0.0/16 range

🔧 Important Configuration Notes
Route Table: Default VPC subnets use main route table with internet gateway

Auto-assign IP: Public IPv4 addresses are auto-assigned in default VPC

Network ACL: Uses default network ACL (allows all traffic)

🎉 Congratulations!
You've completed Day 3! You now have a subnet ready to launch EC2 instances, RDS databases, or other AWS resources in an isolated network segment.
