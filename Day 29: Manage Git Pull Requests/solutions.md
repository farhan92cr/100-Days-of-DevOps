EXTRA:
I can see the issue. When GitHub says "These branches are equal" and shows no differences, it means your story/fox-and-grapes branch hasn't been pushed to the remote repository yet, or it's not detecting the differences properly.

Here's how to fix this:

Step 1: Push Your Branch to Remote
bash
git push origin story/fox-and-grapes
Step 2: Refresh the GitHub Page
After pushing, refresh the GitHub page in your browser.

Step 3: Create the Pull Request
Now you should see differences between the branches, and you'll be able to:

Create the Pull Request - The button should now be active

Add Reviewer - After creating the PR, look for the "Reviewers" section in the right sidebar

Click "Add Reviewer" and search for "tom"

If You Still Don't See "Add Reviewer" Option:
The "Reviewers" section might be:

Collapsed - Look for a "Reviewers" heading and click to expand

In a different location - Sometimes it's under "Assignees" or in the main PR description area

Missing permissions - You might need write access to the repository to add reviewers
